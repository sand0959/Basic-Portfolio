      <p>My name is Ted Sandridge.  I am currently a Produce Manager at Harris Teeter in Carrboro, NC.  I am studying to become a full time Web Developer.</p>
      <p>  I am extremely lucky to have a partner of 14 years named Amanda, and we have a beautiful boxer named Cosette.  I love craft beers and consider myself a "foodie".  I also am an avid European Football fan, being extremely dedicated to Manchester United.</p>
